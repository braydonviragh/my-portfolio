                    My name is Braydon Viragh and I am a front-end developer currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

                    I first began teaching myself how to code in the summer of 2019 and now I have a growing passion for creating unique web designs and engaging web apps. 
                    To pursue this new passion of mine, I enrolled into the Web Development program at Humber College.
                    Now I am constantly learning the most up-to-date development practices and building apps I believe can show real results.

                    Aside from coding I enjoy golf, fitness, basketball, soccer and video games.
